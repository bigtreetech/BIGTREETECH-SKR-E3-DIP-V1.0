Stm32f103xx external SD card storage area simulates EEPROM to store data

Open them in Configuration.h:

# define EEPROM_SETTINGS

# define EEPROM_CHITCHAT

# define EEPROM_AUTO_INIT

Then create an empty file "eeprom.dat" in onboard sd card

The 4K default size is used to simulate eeprom data storage, 
as long as the SD card capacity is large enough to set as much as you want,
the capacity can be edited in Marlin 2.0
